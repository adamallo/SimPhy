// It is useful to know that anything on a line after two forward slashes is ignored.

/*
   Another useful thing to know is that anything after a forward slash and star
   is ignored until INDELible sees a star followed by a forward slash later on.

[TYPE] NUCLEOTIDE 1	//  EVERY control file must begin with a [TYPE] command.
			//  The word can be NUCLEOTIDE, AMINOACID or CODON depending 
			//  on what kind of simulation you want to do but must be in 
			//  upper case. The number can be 1 or 2 and chooses the 
			//  algorithm that INDELible uses (see manuscript). Both give 
			//  identical results but in some cases one is quicker.
			//  Other blocks and commands following this statement
			//  can come in any order you like.

[MODEL]    modelname  	//  Evolutionary models are defined in [MODEL] blocks.
[submodel] JC         	//  Here the substitution model is simply set as JC69.
