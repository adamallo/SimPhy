// It is useful to know that anything on a line after two forward slashes is ignored.

/*
   Another useful thing to know is that anything after a forward slash and star
   is ignored until INDELible finds a star followed by a forward slash later on.

[TYPE] NUCLEOTIDE 1	//  EVERY control file must begin with a [TYPE] command.
			//  The value can be NUCLEOTIDE, AMINOACID or CODON depending 
			//  on what kind of simulation you want to perform but must be in 
			//  upper case. The second parameter can be 1 or 2 and chooses the 
			//  algorithm that INDELible uses (see manuscript). Both give 
			//  identical results but in some cases one is quicker.
			//  Other blocks and commands following this statement
			//  can come in any order you like.
